## SQL Lesson 10: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 1)
For this exercise, we are going to work with our Employees table. Notice how the rows in this table have shared data, which will give us an opportunity to use aggregate functions to summarize some high-level metrics about the teams. Go ahead and give it a shot.

## Table: Employees

Role|Name|Building|Years_employed
-:|-:|-:|-:|
Engineer|Becky A.|1e|4
Engineer|Dan B.|1e|2
Engineer|Sharon F.|1e|6
Engineer|Dan M.|1e|4
Engineer|Malcom S.|1e|1
Artist|Tylar S.|2w|2
Artist|Sherman D.|2w|8
Artist|Jakob J.|2w|6
Artist|Lillia A.|2w|7
Artist|Brandon J.|2w|7
Manager|Scott K.|1e|9
Manager|Shirlee M.|1e|3
Manager|Daria O.|2w|6
